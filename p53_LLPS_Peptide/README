These are the code to choose the best sequence based on Miyazawa-Jernigan statistical contact energy () and Molecular Dynamics simulation energy.
The paper is now in review process. I will attach the paper when it's published.

The code is written in Perl. I used the Perl because I received the legacy code from my professor. These are my first script that I have written, so it's far from good.

I ran the code using strawberry Perl. I also attached the command to run the code in KK_Logs file. The input and output files are inside the Supporting_Files folder.

The result is published as https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17829-1.
