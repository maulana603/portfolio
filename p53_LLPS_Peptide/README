These are the code to choose the best sequence based on Miyazawa-Jernigan statistical contact energy (MJ) and Molecular Dynamics simulation energy (KK).

The code is written in Perl. I used the Perl because I received the legacy code from my professor. These are my first script that I have written, so it's far from good.
For prediction code, it's inside prediction folder. And for the analysis code, it's inside the analysis folder

I ran the code using strawberry Perl. I also attached the command to run the code in KK_cal_log file. The input and output files are inside the Supporting_Files folder.

The result is published as https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17829-1.
