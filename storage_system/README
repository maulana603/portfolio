Python exercise to build a storage system for a client.

[System explanation]
a storage service that allows users to store and view files. In the storage service, users can perform the following three operations: "upload and save files", "delete saved files", and "update saved files".
The fee is the sum of the storage fee, which is determined by the usage of the storage during the month, and the update fee, which is determined by the sum of the file sizes of the updated files during the month.
This service has a free plan that is available free of charge within the restrictions.
